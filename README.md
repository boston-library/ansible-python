# ansible-python

An Ansible role for installing the Python programming language.

## Role Variables

- `python_version` - Python version
- `python_development` - Python development version (default: `False`)

## Reference

This ansible role is taken mostly out of [azavea.postgresql](https://github.com/azavea/ansible-python.git) from Azavea Inc., but I stripped it down for brevity.
